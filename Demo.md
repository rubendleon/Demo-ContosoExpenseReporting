## Demo ##

Throughout the course of this session, we will show the power and flexibility of Windows Azure by taking an on-premises application and associated database, and migrate them to Windows Azure. We will first use our IaaS services to migrate the database to a virtual machine with SQL Server 2012 and the application to a Windows  Azure Cloud Service. We will then highlight our PaaS services by migrating the database to SQL Azure and extend the functionality of the application to use our Windows Azure storage services.

This demo contains the following segments:

1. [Contoso Expense Reporting Application Overview](#segment1).
1. [Migrating to Windows Azure with Virtual Machines & SQL Server 2012](#segment2).
1. [Windows Azure SQL Database](#segment3). 
1. [Windows Azure SQL Federation](#segment4). 
1. [Windows Azure Storage](#segment5).

### Migrating to Windows Azure with Virtual Machines & SQL Server 2012 ###

1. Open the Web browser and go to the Windows Azure Portal at <http://windows.azure.com>

1. Sign in with your Live ID.


	![Sign in](Images/sign-in.png?raw=true "Windows Azure Portal Sign in")

	_Windows Azure Portal sign in_

	>**Speaking Point**
	>
	> The first step in migrating our application to Windows Azure is to create a VM.
	>
	> Let us first navigate to the Windows Azure portal and get signed in.
	>
	> We use Live ID for authentication on the portal, so let’s log on.

1. In the portal, click **New** | **Virtual Machine** | **From Gallery**.

	![Creating Virtual Machine from Gallery](Images/creating-virtual-machine-from-gallery.png?raw=true "Creating Virtual Machine from Gallery")

	_Creating a virtual machine from the Gallery_

	>**Speaking Point**
	>
	> Now that we’re logged in, creating a virtual machine via the portal is easy. Let’s select the virtual machines option in the navigation pane.
	>
	> At least one virtual machine will be created, but we’re going to create a new virtual machine that has SQL Server 2012. To do that, we’re going to select the **FROM GALLERY** option.
	>
	>You can use **Quick Create** if you only need one virtual machine that doesn’t need to be load-balanced or joined to a virtual network or
**From Gallery** if you have more complex solution. With the latter, you have more flexibility in how the machine is used in advanced scenarios.

1.	In the **CREATE VIRTUAL MACHINE** dialog, select the **Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Evaluation** option.
1.	Click the right arrow (Next).


	![Selecting Virtual Machine OS version](Images/selecting-virtual-machine-os-version.png?raw=true "Selecting Virtual Machine OS version")

	_Selecting an OS version for the virtual machine_

	>**Speaking Point**
	>
	> Notice all the different VM’s that we have in our gallery. As you can see, we have many VMs that include Linux, as well as several Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 VMs.
	>
	>We also have, as you can see, a SQL Server 2012 VM. This VM is running SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Evaluation edition which is the VM we want to create, so let’s select that one.

1.	The second page of the **Create Virtual Machine** wizard is the **VM Configuration**. Enter the following:
	- **Virtual Machine Name**: _ContosExpenseVM_
	- **Password**: _Passw0rd!_

1.	Enter the password for the administrator account, then re-enter the password for confirmation.
1. Select _Large_ as the **SIZE** of the VM.

	![VM Configuration page](Images/vm-configuration-page.png?raw=true "VM Configuration page")

	_VM configuration page_

	>**Speaking Point**
	>
	> Now what we need to do is give our virtual machine a name. This is the portal display name.
	>
	>We also need to supply an administrator password. 
	>
	>More  importantly, however, we also need to select the size of the VM. There are several size options:
	>
	>	- Extra Small
	>	- Small
	>	- Medium
	>	- Large
	>	- Extra Large
	>
	>These sizes differ, as we can see, in the amount of CPU cores and memory allotted to the VM. It is important that the VM we select will suffice for our needs.

1.	The third page of the **CREATE VIRTUAL MACHINE** wizard is the **VM Mode.** Select the **STANDALONE VIRTUAL MACHINE** option.
1.	Enter a _unique_ **DNS NAME** for the virtual machine.
1.	For the **STORAGE ACCOUNT**, leave the default at **Use Automatically Generated Storage Account**.
1. Choose a suitable **REGION/AFFINITY GROUP/VIRTUAL NETWORK** where the VM will be deployed.

	![VM Mode page](Images/vm-mode-page.png?raw=true "VM Mode page")

	_VM Mode page_

	>**Speaking Point**
	>
	> Now, we need to select the type of virtual machine. In other words, is this going to be new standalone virtual machine, or are we connecting to an existing virtual machine? With the new IaaS domain features, we have the ability to join this VM to an existing domain. However, for the purposes of this demo, we’ll simply create a standalone VM.
	>
	> Next, we need to supply a DNS name for this VM. 
	> 
	> These VMs are stored in blob storage and we need to specify whether our VM will use a Windows Azure account tied to our subscription, if we created one, or use an automatically generated storage account. Since we haven’t created a storage account yet, we’ll use the automatically generated account.
Lastly, we need to specify in which region to create the VM. 


1.	The fourth and final page of the **CREATE VIRTUAL MACHINE** wizard is the **VM Options.** 
1.	Select **Create Availability Set**, and set the **AVAILABILITY SET NAME** to **MyAvailSet**.
1. Click Finish (check mark).

	![VM Options page](Images/vm-options-page.png?raw=true "VM Options page")

	_VM Options page_

	>**Speaking Point**
	>
	> Lastly, we need to select an availability set in which to create the VM. 
	>
	> An availability set is a group of machines that are deployed across multiple locations (commonly called fault domains). Availability sets are used to protect from outages.
	> 
	>So, we’ll select the **Create Availability Set** option and name the availability set as _MyAvailSet_.
	>
	>Great, we are done! We can see in the portal that our VM is being provisioned.

1. For expediency, you may now switch over to a virtual machine that you have previously provisioned. This VM must be configured with:

	- Microsoft SQL Server 2012
	- An endpoint configured for TCP port 1433 to enable remote access to the SQL Server instance
	- TCP port 1433 opened in the Windows Firewall
	- SQL Server authentication enabled in SQL Server
	- An additional SQL Server login configured with SQL Server authentication and assigned to the _sysadmin_ server role

	Otherwise, you need to complete the following steps to configure the VM.

1.	In the **Windows Azure Portal**, select the VM you created previously.
1.	Select the **ENDPOINTS** view, and then click **ADD ENDPOINT** in the command bar.
1.	In the **ADD ENDPOINT** dialog, select **Add Endpoint** and then click the right arrow to go to the next page.
